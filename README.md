# Pong-DQN
A Pong player using Deep Reinforcement Learning with Pytorch and OpenAI Gym based on a DQN model

I wrote this because I wanted to apply what I had learned about DQN and DeepRL in a project.

The code is well commented and straightforward, you can use at as a reference example in order to better understand the basic DQN algorithm.
